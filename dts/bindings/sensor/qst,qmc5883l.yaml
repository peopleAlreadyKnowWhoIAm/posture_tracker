  The QMC5883L is a 3-axis digital magnetometer from QST.
  It is used to measure the magnetic field in three dimensions.
  The device communicates over I2C and has a range of Â±8 gauss.
  It is commonly used in applications such as compasses, navigation systems, and robotics.

  Example definition in devicetree:

    qmc5883l: qmc5883l@0d {

        reg = <0x0d>;
        sampling-frequency = <100>;
        magnetic-field-range = <8>;
        oversampling = <64>;
    }
